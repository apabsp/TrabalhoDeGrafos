    weight : string or function
        If it is callable, `weight` itself is returned. If it is a string,

    function
        This function returns a callable that accepts exactly three inputs:
        a node, an node adjacent to the first one, and the edge attribute
        dictionary for the eedge joining those nodes. That function returns
        a number representing the weight of an edge.

    If `G` is a multigraph, and `weight` is not callable, the
    minimum edge weight over all parallel edges is returned. If any edge
    does not have an attribute with key `weight`, it is assumed to
    have weight one.

    Parameters
    ----------
    G : NetworkX graph

        be one.

        If this is a function, the weight of an edge is the value
        returned by the function. The function must accept exactly three
        positional arguments: the two endpoints of an edge and the
        dictionary of edge attributes for that edge. The function must
        return a number or None to indicate a hidden edge.

    Returns
    -------
    distance, path : pair of dictionaries, or numeric and list
        If target is None, returns a tuple of two dictionaries keyed by node.
        The first dictionary stores distance from one of the source nodes.
        The second stores the path from one of the sources to that node.
        If target is not None, returns a tuple of (distance, path) where
        distance is the distance from source to target and path is a list
        representing the path from source to target.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> G = nx.path_graph(5)

    Notes
    -----
    Edge weight attributes must be numerical.
    Distances are calculated as sums of weighted edges traversed.

    The weight function can be used to hide edges by returning None.
    So ``weight = lambda u, v, d: 1 if d['color']=="red" else None``
